History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Music has come in many eras, as it has evolved over time

Prehistoric Era

Music began in Prehistoric times, to no real surprise. It was before any
recorded history and is said to have been started very late in the Earth's geologic history.
Native tribes invented their own folk songs, with no real origin. It may have been inspired by
natural sounds and rhythms, but no one is really sure what happened back then. This was all
for entertainment and tribal rituals. Instruments were most likely mainly human voices,
but a 43,500 year old artifact called the "Divje Babe Flute" may be a primitive flute made out of
a bear femur, but it could also be a random bone with some teeth holes in it. 

Ancient Era

Once a written language was developed, the prehistoric music era ended. The oldest known song was 
written in cuneiform 3400 years ago in Syria, with many more probably written before it. Many writings
and drawings show that people started to join together to create music together and make combined
sounds. Instruments were clearly depicted in many drawings, showing the importance of this in culture.
Greece even created choruses and invented many new instruments, like the lyre. 

Early Music

Medieval

Although Medieval culture has seemed to be heavily influenced by music, the only record of an actual musical
work is from 800 AD, the plainsong of the catholic church. 

Culture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Folk Culture

Music has pretty much always been a part of human lives. No one knows how long it has truly been, but its been
long before recorded history. Originally, music was used as a way to fight boredom and tell stories of everyday
life. This way of using music was mostly in small folk cultures, and still is practiced the few folk cultures that survive today.

Popular Culture

In a popular culture setting, music is created to spread and globalize. This form of sharing music was characterized by the 
invention of the radio and other communication techniques. The largest contributers to making music in a popular culture
are the American and European cultures, but because of technology, the culture of music is starting to spread rapidly. 
The most interesting thing about music today is that it is extremely diverse. With so many of these differeny genres,
people can enjoy music in thousands of different ways; there are too many to list off. Pop music has been the biggest
trend of the last few decades because of its peppy feel and tone, but some other popular genres have been things like
rock.

Science
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Music makes us feel different ways based on what it is: that much is obvious. The way it affects out brains is very
interesting and diffent than you might think. Let's dive deeper into it.

Happy/Sad Music

The way our brain interprets music actually distorts our perspective of other people. Even after hearing short clips of
happy or sad music, people would interpret faces that were neutral to match what the music was portraying. Happy and sad
music also comes with two emotions: perceived emotions and felt emotions, which means we can understand emotion in 
music without actaully feeling these emotions. Instead, we can enojoy the music without being dampered too much by its tone.

Noise and Music

Creative work is hard, especially when there is a loud source of noise that is with it. However, a moderate noise level
has been found to actually boost creativity. This is moderate noise increases processing difficulty, and leads to higher
creativity as a result. That really means that when we are having difficulty, our brains tend to resort to creative approaches
to solve problems. High noise levels overwhelm processing too much.

Personality

The study used for this information may be slightly unreliable because of the amount of generalizing done, but it could still be 
mostly true. There were 5 traits observed in this study: openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, 
and emotional stability. Here are some connections they found:
<ul>
	<li>Blues fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing, gentle and at ease</li>
	<li>Jazz fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing and at ease</li>
	<li>Classical music fans have high self-esteem, are creative, introvert and at ease</li>
	<li>Rap fans have high self-esteem and are outgoing</li>
	<li>Opera fans have high self-esteem, are creative and gentle</li>
	<li>Country and western fans are hardworking and outgoing</li>
	<li>Reggae fans have high self-esteem, are creative, not hardworking, outgoing, gentle and at ease</li>
	<li>Dance fans are creative and outgoing but not gentle</li>
	<li>Indie fans have low self-esteem, are creative, not hard working, and not gentle</li>
	<li>Rock/heavy metal fans have low self-esteem, are creative, not hard-working, not outgoing, gentle, and at ease</li>
	<li>Chart pop fans have high self-esteem, are hardworking, outgoing and gentle, but are not creative and not at ease</li>
</ul>

Again, take this with a grain of salt, because this is all pretty much a generalization based on one study. It's not as
unreliable as a horoscope, but still should be regarded carefully.

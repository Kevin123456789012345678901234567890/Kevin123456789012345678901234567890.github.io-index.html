		<h2>Prehistoric Era</h2>
		<br/> 
		<p class="text">
		Music began in Prehistoric times, to no real surprise. It was before any
		recorded history and is said to have been started very late in the Earth's geologic history.
		Native tribes invented their own folk songs, with no real origin. It may have been inspired by
		natural sounds and rhythms, but no one is really sure what happened back then. This was all
		for entertainment and tribal rituals. Instruments were most likely mainly human voices,
		but a 43,500 year old artifact called the "Divje Babe Flute" may be a primitive flute made out of
		a bear femur, but it could also be a random bone with some teeth holes in it. </p>

		<h2>Ancient Era</h2>
		<br/> 
		<p class="text">
		Once a written language was developed, the prehistoric music era ended. The oldest known song was 
		written in cuneiform 3400 years ago in Syria, with many more probably written before it. Many writings
		and drawings show that people started to join together to create music together and make combined
		sounds. Instruments were clearly depicted in many drawings, showing the importance of this in culture.
		Greece even created choruses and invented many new instruments, like the lyre. </p>

		<h2>Medieval</h2>
		<br/> 
		<p class="text">
		Although Medieval culture has seemed to be heavily influenced by music, the only record of an actual musical
		work is from 800 AD, the plainsong of the catholic church. In this time of about 800 AD, the church started
		effort to unify these plainsongs and chants or supress the ones that didn;t support Gregorian liturgy. Polyphonic 
		music (texture of music that blends many aspects of the way it is sung) was sung for the first time, and music
		notation resurfaced after being gone for a long time. Schools for music were starting to appear after 1100. Several
		music ideas were starting to surface that helped form the Renaissance Era of music, like troubadours, composers of 
		Old Occitan lyric poetry. In the 13th century, sacred music was developed, and so did Geisslerlieder, or the music
		of wandering bands. In the 14th century, a style of music called <em>ars nova</em> was formed, which is a late 
		Medieval Style that closely relates to the Renaissance of Music.</p>

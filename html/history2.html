				<h2>Renaissance Music</h2>
				<p class="text">
				The Renaissance for music began not in Italy, like every other Renaissance, but in Northern Europe, mainly
				in places like France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, around the 14th century. Burgundian Composers were what the 
				composers in this area were called, and they were based on a music style called <em>ars subtilior</em>, a style 
				with a blended melody and balance throughout. Then, in the mid-15th century, composers migrated from West Europe
				and went in to Eastern Europe, especially Italy, and this spread their style. The invention of the printing press
				in this era revolutionized music and helped musicians establish their styles, and it also established an international
				style for European music. In the mid 16th century, this international style broke down, and many diverse styles
				emerged from this breakdown, such as the Venetian school developing orchestration and instrumental parts. In the
				late 16th century, most countries in Europe had their own styles and traditions. Florentine Camerata didn't like
				many new forms of music, and decided to revive Greek traditions of music, creating opera. Before 1600, music was
				mostly modal, relying on styles of music to define how it was read. After 1600, music began to be more tonal, which
				led to the Baroque Period.

				<h2>Baroque Music</h2>
				<p class="text">
				This era took place from 1600 to 1750, and made the Baroque artistic style. This style included many independent
				melodies working together in one song. Composers typically wrote music for small ensembles. In this period, the
				fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto were all expanded upon. Many composers were influential in this 
				period, like Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi.

				<h2>Classical Music</h2>
				<p class="text">
				This era was characterized by homophonic texture or a melody with accompaniment. The melodies were often
				voice-like, which led to many classical pieces being transformed into operas. There were stronger and 
				clearer melodies, and counterpoint, which is playing a melody in conjunction with another, was especially
				popular in music. The sonata, symphony, and concerto were the most polular forms. The Mannheim School 
				pioneered the Classical Era with composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert.

				<h2>Romantic Music</h2>
				<p class="text">
				Music in this period was more emotional and expressive, which expanded on literature, art, and philosophy.
				Early composers were Schumann, Chopin, and others.In the late 19th century, there was a large boom in size 
				of orchestra. Composers in the second half with this increase in orchestra size were Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Wagner,
				and others. In the late part of this era, many songs were created to promote nationalism.

				<h2>Recent Music</h2>
				<p class="text">
				With the invention of things like the radio, music popularity surged worldwide, and 
				everyone wanted to cash in on the new success of music. Music became portable and easy
				to get access to, and new electronic instruments were invented. Amplifiers were invented, 
				allowing even more people to hear the new sounds being created by technology. Recordings of
				music was the most influential part of the 20th century of music because it made everything
				easy to get, and created new industries.

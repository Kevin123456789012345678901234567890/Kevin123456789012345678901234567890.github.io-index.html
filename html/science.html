				<h2>Happy/Sad Music</h2>
					<p class="text"> 
					The way our brain interprets music actually distorts our perspective of other people. Even after hearing short clips of
happy or sad music, people would interpret faces that were neutral to match what the music was portraying. Happy and sad
music also comes with two emotions: perceived emotions and felt emotions, which means we can understand emotion in 
music without actaully feeling these emotions. Instead, we can enojoy the music without being dampered too much by its tone.

					<h2>Noise and Music</h2>
					<p class="text">
					Creative work is hard, especially when there is a loud source of noise that is with it. However, a moderate noise level
has been found to actually boost creativity. This is moderate noise increases processing difficulty, and leads to higher
creativity as a result. That really means that when we are having difficulty, our brains tend to resort to creative approaches
to solve problems. High noise levels overwhelm processing too much.

				<h2>Personality</h2>
					<div class="text">
					The study used for this information may be slightly unreliable because of the amount of generalizing done, but it could still be 
mostly true. There were 5 traits observed in this study: openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, 
and emotional stability. Here are some connections they found:
<ul>
	<li>Blues fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing, gentle and at ease</li>
	<li>Jazz fans have high self-esteem, are creative, outgoing and at ease</li>
	<li>Classical music fans have high self-esteem, are creative, introvert and at ease</li>
	<li>Rap fans have high self-esteem and are outgoing</li>
	<li>Opera fans have high self-esteem, are creative and gentle</li>
	<li>Country and western fans are hardworking and outgoing</li>
	<li>Reggae fans have high self-esteem, are creative, not hardworking, outgoing, gentle and at ease</li>
	<li>Dance fans are creative and outgoing but not gentle</li>
	<li>Indie fans have low self-esteem, are creative, not hard working, and not gentle</li>
	<li>Rock/heavy metal fans have low self-esteem, are creative, not hard-working, not outgoing, gentle, and at ease</li>
	<li>Chart pop fans have high self-esteem, are hardworking, outgoing and gentle, but are not creative and not at ease</li>
</ul>

Again, take this with a grain of salt, because this is all pretty much a generalization based on one study. It's not as
unreliable as a horoscope, but still should be regarded carefully.

			<h2>Folk Culture</h2>

			<p class="text">
			Music has pretty much always been a part of human lives. No one knows how long it has truly been, but its been
long before recorded history. Originally, music was used as a way to fight boredom and tell stories of everyday
life. This way of using music was mostly in small folk cultures, and still is practiced the few folk cultures that survive today.

			<h2>Popular Culture</h2>
			
			<p class="text">
			In a popular culture setting, music is created to spread and globalize. This form of sharing music was characterized by the 
invention of the radio and other communication techniques. The largest contributers to making music in a popular culture
are the American and European cultures, but because of technology, the culture of music is starting to spread rapidly. 
The most interesting thing about music today is that it is extremely diverse. With so many of these differeny genres,
people can enjoy music in thousands of different ways; there are too many to list off. Pop music has been the biggest
trend of the last few decades because of its peppy feel and tone, but some other popular genres have been things like
rock.
